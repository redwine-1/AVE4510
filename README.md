# Model and Simulation Sessional (AVE 4510) - MATLAB Code Repository

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and simulation files created during the AVE 4510 course I took during my 5th semester. The purpose of this repository is to store, share and document the scripts and Simulink files used during the course. 

## Course Objectives
1. Train of students in the field of modelling and simulation-supported development methodology
2. Teach the usage of different loops in MATLAB and the usage of Simulink
3. Validation of the simulations through real test

## Course Outcomes (CO):
1. Demonstrate associated skills regarding using MATLAB and simulation software.
2. Create suitable simulation models in MATLAB/Simulink
3. Compute engineering problems using MATLAB and COMSOL software
